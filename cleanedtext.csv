0,this case is just beautiful. i cannot think of anything i do not like about it. i used a smaller-sized gtx 750 which allows you to see everything inside. a bigger video card blocks your view (probably by design).,1.0
1,my husband purchased these because he likes movies and i am a reader.  i hear no residual sound and the headphones seem to be quite comfortable.  i highly recommend them!,1.0
2,"very disappointed.  this item worked a time or two, but never consistently. i replaced the battery and it still would not work.  i followed company instructions to make it work.  do not waste your money.",0.0
3,"...first of all, this lightning cable does exactly what it is supposed to do: it moves data (and electricity) to the apple device it is connected to (in my case, an ipod nano (7th generation).

with this cable, you get a little more.

first, you get more length. at 6 feet, it will give you flexibility for where to place your lighting device at a twice the distance of a standard lightning cable.

second, the usb terminal on this cable includes a permanently mounted velco cable management strap, answering the needs of neat freaks.

while you can buy cheaper lightning cables, the extra length and cable management capability offer a good value at this price.

select with confidence.

4,"very bad, slow, flakey software. very slow. i was replacing a buffalo nas i've had for many years and this has been a complete step down. i have almost zero trust in this thing at all.",0.0
5,"when it worked it was fine (used for my media center pc in living room) but died under a year. range was good, kept it 15 to 20 ft from pc. there is no on/off switch on keyboard, so you never know if it is turned on or off (the mouse has a switch).

no lights or indicators to tell you if it is connected, low battery, or anything. so when mine stopped working i had  no way of knowing if was turned off, not connected or the batteries are dead.  pretty much just kept trying stuff to figure out why it is was not working- trial and error.  ultimately i realized none of those things were the problem, and instead it was just a piece of junk.

just not worth the aggravation. lack of an on/off switch on the keyboard alone rules this one out.",0.0

7,"the remote basically gives you access to everything you need on your g-box.  however, its longevity leaves much to be desired.  they feel cheap.  the buttons are clunky and just do not feel responsive when you press them.  i have 2 g-box midnight boxes.  one of the remotes is very unresponsive.  the arrow keys and the power button are only responsive 75% of the time.  the other completely died in less than a year from very light use.  i purchased secondary remotes to do most of the actions once the box is turned on.  it is poorly manufactured.  i have a g-box q.  while it does not have all of the buttons that this one does, but it is ""way"" more responsive, feels better, and controls just enough of what i need it to when i do not want to fish for my secondary remote.  i purchased this remote exclusively for turning my boxes on and off.  hopefully, it lasts longer than a year.",0.0
8,"display looks muted/faded - contrast not crisp at all. speakers are overwhelmingly weak and tinny. browsing is sluggish, even when doing simple tasks such as email. i'm a big youtube watcher and will often have 4 or 5 tabs open with different videos loaded; this chromebook cannot even handle two tabs with videos. it freezes indefinitely, forcing me to close it... it will not restart if i try to press the power button. even when i'm just surfing news articles, the tab navigation is frustratingly sluggish - every time i go away from a tab and come back to that tab, the page looks blank (white) and takes 2-8 seconds to reload, as if it is refreshing the content. absolutely unacceptably annoying.  on top of all that, the video playback quality is poor and i have no idea why.  i hate this product and want to return it but the company (america's distributor) will not take it.  wish i never bought this.",0.0

11,"this is not an actual replacement for the charger that comes with the fitbit flex. it does not have the reset button, which is critical for resetting your fitbit. this will only charge your device. if you have lost the original charger, you cannot use this to reset your device. while advertised only as a charger, i feel like it was misleading and irresponsible for the product description to omit this fact. you would think that their quality assurance process would include checking to make sure their product met oem specifications. very disappointed.",0.0

13,"one word sums it up ""wow!""  i bought a the hddvd version of ""phantom of the opera"" plus i owned a regular dvd version.  when i compared them on the new hddvd player i could not get over the change in picture.  it was like watching this video on 35mm film.  the quality is excellent.  i have it connected to my in focus video projector on a 100"" screen.  i was totally blown away.  the unit i have for my sound system is a 7.1 denon which to me is perfect.  the new sound quality on the hddvd is also amazing.  running a regular dvd on this new hddvd unit is also better quality.  it is a win win situation.  i'm sure in time the price, like everything else, will come down.

you will not be disappointed in this unit.  if you have an hdtv you best get the hddvd player.  you will be missing a lot if you do not.  i would give this unit 100 stars if i could.  once your connected, it is easy to run.  the new features are also great and there is just so much to choose from.  happy watching!!!!!",1.0
14,"i really just wanted a rolling laptop bag (which does not seem to exist?), whereas this is a small suitcase that has sleeves for a couple laptops in the top.  i generally have the bag empty and two laptops in the sleeves, which means the ""door"" is really heavy and there is nothing underneath holding up the weight, which puts a lot of stress on the zipper.  also, i'm using it every day to schlep these darned (heavy) laptops around, so it is getting a lot of use.  i'm not sure how long the zipper will last, so i might switch to putting the laptops in the body of the suitcase.  all in all, though, it looks good, holds laptops easily, rolls well, handle extends and collapses readily, etc.  for the price, it is better than i expected.",1.0

16,at first we were a little disappointed because it was not working with the tablet until we had to go and get an adapter to connect it. once we got the correct adapter it was great. so easy to use and so handy with our 7in tablet makes things much easier to type on the tablet. the stylus that comes with it is a downfall because it did not work at all with the tablet. other than that everything else is great.,1.0

22,"to clarify from the start, this is not a review of the entire camera itself, but rather an alert to potential buyers of the lumix zs25.  i just purchased the camera and discovered that it does not have stereo microphones as amazon's detailed description page clearly states!

this may not be a problem for some, but the zs19, zs20 and zs30 have stereo mics and i definitely wanted this feature in the zs25!  panasonic, what is wrong with you??  why would you offer this otherwise attractive camera with full hd video and not stereo audio??  i'm baffled by that one.

so do not take this as a review of the remaining features of the camera itself, but just beware that it records mono audio and the product description is a lie!",0.0

for its size, its not that heavy. it is ok, for travelling for a short amount of time.
excellent for using it in a house or at work.
i carry mine around my house (in my bed, in the kitchen, in the terrace) and its very easy to transport.
the performance is great. i erase the windows vista it came with and upgraded to windows 7 and is working as a charm.  windows xp works great as well.
the screen is a delight!! as crisp as an lcd tv. and the blue ray works great.
no noise and not too much glare.
i love it when i'm using graphics software, specially my photo editing ones (a.photoshop)

32,"amazingly this works as advertised.  setup was simple and quick...no hassle.  in less than an hour i had everything installed and working.  the actual monitoring does not start until 3 days after you activate.  this is to allow you time for testing the system without notifying the police.  once that three days is up you will get an email telling you that your system is now fully monitored and the police will be notified in the event of an alarm breach.

the only complaint i have it that the extra horn we ordered would not work at first.  i opened it up and they had only installed 3 batteries (takes 4).  i added an extra battery and it still did not work.  the three that were in it were dead...after replacing those everything worked fine.  despite this slight inconvenience i still felt this was worthy of a 5-star rating due to the ease of setup and the basic fact that it works as advertised.",1.0

i do agree with others about the issues with noise from handling, the small switches (i often have to put my glasses on to see the switches!), and the sudden battery popping out bit.

82,"i really liked the headphones, they are light and comfortable, and i do not even feel them while walking. the sound is pretty good too, setup was easy, and initially was happy.

the problem came when i tried to use them while walking, the sound kept cutting in and out. if i had my iphone7 in my hand or breast pocket, there was no sound issues, but as soon as it went in my back pocket, it started cutting out again.
i contacted skullcandy for support who gave me some troubleshooting to do. i tried the steps and no improvement.
they provided more steps which involved leaving the headphones powered off for 24hrs. this is where i started to get annoyed as they refused to advise why i needed to leave them for 24hrs. i asked 3 times for the reasons behind this. i have done technical support in one for or another for 18yrs and know that this is just a fob off.

update on 3/8/2016.  i really hate this bluetooth.  i thought it was just like my voyager legend but it is not.  it does not talk to you to tell you it is on or needs charging or to say you are getting a call, nothing.  the legend tells you if it needs to be recharged.  this one will just turn off without notification.  it sucks and i do not even use it.  i bought two more of the legends recently and will only use them.  on the legend you can push a button and it tells you how much talk time you have left before needing to be charged and it also announces who is calling.  this one just does not talk at all.",0.0

this charger is specified at 15v output (see the features listed in the item's description on this page above), while the philips qg3330, for example, is rated at 4.3v (stamped on the shaver body). philips has a variety of shavers/trimmers, some of them indeed require 15v to charge, but some do not! in short, you need to match the charger to the device.

  -  1.3mp photo shot
  -  built in flash (for camera mode)
  -  terminal for zoom mic (though i cannot find sharp's zoom mic available anywhere at this time)
  -  and other features that should be available in other camcorder (e.g. 10x zoom, digital effect, stabilizer, etc)
the things i want to have in the camcorder (though it is not a big deal to me) are:
  -  microphone input
  -  night shot mode
since this is my first camcorder, i do not know if other camcorder have better picture quality or not.  but it looks good to me both on tv and after captured onto computer.

so why is not to like?  just this: after about 5 months of use, the laser stopped tracking on my desktop and in fact on most surfaces.  now the mouse only tracks on high-gloss surfaces like polished metal or magazine covers.  when i contacted logitech about my problem, the customer support agent suggested that i try a different usb port (despite my providing the model number, which is only for a bluetooth mouse) and that i try using a different computer (despite giving plenty of detail describing that there are no communication issues between the mouse and my computer).

works well for spinning lens elements, and also a handy place on which to stand a partially disassembled lens while working on it.

there is a decent amount of flash (overflow) on the parting lines of the finished parts.  it looks sloppy, but does not effect how they work.  probably appropriate for the price of the kit.

lighter in weight than my lead acid ones. it charges fast.....but.....not to be recharged when half discharged unless you have an ""intelligent"" charger that tapers the charge as it nears full. the original panasonic charger just socks the charge to it. this did not hurt the lead acid, original batteries. it gets this one hot....really hot, if it is overcharged.

anyway...this fits my ag-456up video camera perfectly. the one complaint with the company is that they add $4.99 for each battery shipping. several will fit in a priority mail flat rate box....and the shipping for up to 6 of these should only be about $11.",1.0

1) the cpu is capable of handling dual-channel ram, but it only comes with one ram module.  add a 2nd module to get a nice memory bandwidth boost -- this should make the cpu and the graphics just a little bit faster.  note that mine came with a low-voltage 4g module, so i had to hunt for another low-voltage one to put in there (i added a samsung).

really a shame that they used such a brittle plastic.  the keyboard itself is responsive and easy to type on.  it rivals my full size mbp keyboard.  alas, a great keyboard is only as good as the case in which it sits.

the form factor was great and the fit in my ears was pretty good. the bass however was not as good as i have heard in other earbuds and most importantly, the noise canceling was almost non-existent. it is true that i am comparing them to one of the best noise canceling headphones available and i did not expect the phiaton earbuds to be as good as the bose, but i was hoping they would perform well enough that i could take them on my trip in lieu of the bose headphones. sadly, this was not the case as i could barely tell the difference between the noise canceling turned on and having it turned off on the phiaton earbuds.

this headset just broke on me just now so i thought i'd make a review to warn other people about this product to not get it. i only tried putting it on and it snapped. you are better off paying extra for headsets that go over the top of your head instead the back of your neck.

i bought this from my local fry's store and after a few hours of using, i noticed that headset pinches the top of your ears. i would generally have to move it in a different position because it would get uncomfortable when gaming and i do not even have a big head. even my $7 mic (which broke after 4 years of use) from wal-mart lasted longer than this!

(2) although the product description promises hours of battery life, i find that these headphones begin indicating they have a low battery after just one workday. they do come with a cord so that you can plug them into your device and conserve battery, but it is a bit convenient to need to recharge these after every day's use.

when it was working it worked fine.

it is loud, so if you are on the phone or making a video, or webinar or something like that--it will be heard and commented upon by other people.

also, the cables are huge and come out in the center of the keyboard, so in my case i was unable to put it close to my laptop, so it took up a lot of desk space.

and the cables are bundled together. that is okay if your sound ports are next to two usb ports. on my laptop the sound ports were next to only one usb port so i needed to have extra cables to reach everything.

464,"so, you wanted to find a cheap cool looking raspberry pi case. prepare to be disappointed; all of the cheap ones out there are a stylish pink or feature some tint of color you do not want. so, naturally, you go for the clear. good choice.

it was a little hard to assemble at first, but the pictures on amazon were what made it click together for me. the only slight issue is the base panel looks like it is acrylic is bubbling; however, this is not noticable because it is covered by the pi itself. it is pretty neat, you have decent access to the gpio ports, as well as direct access through the top.

ps: do not open from the side, open from the top. for assembly, you just jam the usb port into the plastic piece. do not break it, you can do it easily without bending/scratching it. it is not a conflicting piece!",1.0

this exercise system is great for anyone who wants to stay in shape for everyday life.  since the heaviest weight for any exercise for the trx is your own body weight, a body builder or professional athlete will need more resistance than your body weight provides, so a body builder/pro will need free weights or weight machines.  but for travel or supplementary exercise, the trx may still be useful for the advanced user.",1.0

however, the arm/tentacle mount for the gopro is flimsy and does not stand up to any movement.  this is problematic because it will ruin any shots or videos that you have.  it does not stay in a consistent position, and i've found that it will not even hold the weight of the gopro when you stand perfectly still.

smart phones, tablets, laptops, and even battery chargers for digital cameras do not require a voltage converter. all you need is an adapter to plug into a foreign outlet (and it is becoming pretty common for hotels and airports to have universal outlets).

there are few electronic devices that you are likely to travel with that require a voltage converter  and some like a hair drier should not be used with the bestek converter.

what i use the converter for is my electric toothbrush which will not work with 220-240. there are universal charging bases, but i was having a hard time ordering one so i just went with this.

679,"i have these and tried them and they are ok, but i like outside the ear phones better. reasons:

a. they isolate ambient sound better

b. they feel more comfortable

c. they do not add decibles to the sound you hear

note that according to audiologists, inside the ear phones add about 7 decibles to the sound you are generating (because the phones are directly inside your ear canal). thus, if you are listening at 90 dbl, it becomes 97. potentially tinnitis producing !!

if you want to isolate ambient sound, such as in an office environment, i would suggest bose or ex29 ""extreme isolation"" headphones. the ex29s are about $ 90 and are big, but they work very well.",0.0

pros: super fast.  i switched out the hdd with a 120gb patriot wildfire, and moved the hdd to a caddy in the dvd bay.  i also upped the ram to 14gb.  audio is loud and clear enough (not great quality) to listen to music on.  has an hdmi out and vga out so i can plug in both my monitors when i work.
cons: the keyboard layout is a bit different and took me awhile to get used to.  if you do not adapt to key layout changes well, you may want a usb keyboard or a different computer.  its a bit of a big laptop.  i knew this when i was buying it, but once i had it in my hands, i was like wow.  i have nick named mine ""the monolith"".",1.0

the biggest problem is that one of the tabs of the case, meant to hold the tablet, actually ended up sliding out of place. this put the tablet askew and more likely to fall out and end up damaged. another thing to keep in mind is that the stylus is not capacitive. this means that it is very possible that it will not work with a tablet screen. so while it works for something temporary, it will not last much longer than a couple of months.",0.0

otherwise, the sound quality is what i expected from a $50 walkman (for those of you who are getting bad sound quality - it may be a headphone problem, go buy better ones) - the earphones that come with the set are not great, but i was not expecting to use them anyways.  i have a better pair of headphones.",1.0

the packaging was the original packaging of the product and was in excellent condition.

the connections themselves are easy to understand but the included toslink cable was not working for me. thankfully, i had, accidently, purchased an amazon basics toslink cable which suddenly became useful. replaced the toslink cable and voila!, everything was working just fine.
it took me a while to figure out what was actually wrong with the setup (i initially thought it was the headphones) but finally nailed it to the cable.

overall, i am very satisfied with the product - it does what it says it will, and there is no discernible loss in audio quality. i am no audiophile but i do know a good quality sound thanks to my extensive exposure to klipsch products. just make sure you get an additional toslink cable as the included does not really inspire confidence.",1.0

 well the manufacture had an email address to address what i now consider deceptive advertisement because of that pesky hidden *, and the fact that it clearly says stereo speakers, so i sent him an email, it has been over a week now and they do not even have the decency to reply to me, so folks do not waste your time..",0.0

1463,"i love my zune!  to be honest, i am a self-proclaimed apple hater so i was looking for an alternative to the itouch.  also i did not really need all the extra added features of the itouch for almost $100 more.  my zune is used mostly just as an mp3 player.  i do however check my email with it on occasion and play some games.  which for me is just an added bonus.
the screen quality is awesome, very bright and vibrant.  and the touch screen sensitivity is great as well (now it is very frustrating to try and use the touch screen on my gps).  the g-sensor is excellent as well.
also the sound quality on this is excellent.  the music is crisp and clear.  like i said, listening to music is the main reason i purchased this, so the sound quality was very important.

these also stay solidly in place when riding a bicycle or performing gymnastic moves.  and best of all, the level of sound quality is so good that i can hear very subtle sounds even beyond the music, such as the occasional glitch in a computer's dac unit (mainly when there is no actual sound being played).

it is a little easier to handle with the case on it, easier to get a grip.

1846,"i'm a first time user of monitor stands. overall, the wali dual lcd monitor is pretty good. i just installed it in my new desk setup. initially i was going to rate this lower since out of the box, the horizontal arms come un-leveled, meaning when you mount your monitors, they will not been aligned if they were the same model. in order to resolve that, you have to go back and unscrew the nut cap and use the smallest allen wrench provided and turn the inner key within the bolt counter-clockwise and raise the lower of the two monitors. somebody mentioned it earlier but i had to do my research and go back to the manual (never throw those suckers away). additionally, when the product arrived, there were slight scratches to the top of the vertical bar, but unnoticeable after setup.

cons: button placement is odd, and bluetooth reception is absolute garbage. in any position my phone is in, either in my back pocket or front belt--the connection pops and is mildly annoying. however, once i turn my head 10 degrees to the left the connection begins to crap out. i've left the phone on a bench and did pushups next to it and the connection was garbled. i've tried two different phones, the bluetooth is such a low quality connection and cuts out. i want to throw these across the street and have a dog eat them. do not purchase these earphones unless you plan to wear your shirt on your arm, even then the connection may crap out.",0.0

deducted a star because there is some slight skipping as i ran but that may be from keeping my phone in my water bottle pouch. it is not a showstopper by any means and many other bluetooth headphones have the same issue.

 btw: if the alarm is important to you -- as it is for me since i frequently exceed a safe maximum hr -- be aware that the alarm on the t5k738 is not audible in most environments unless you exercise with your wrist in your ear.

1928,"awful. the watch itself seems ok. its what to be expected for a replica. really watered down.
that is not the problem.
first. the bluetooth disconnects every 5 min or so. disconnects more when you link your calls, and not just straight bluetooth. this get redundant if it does not stay connected.
second, the battery is not held in by anything. it just sits there. it continuously falls off. there is no clips, no clasp...nothing.
a simple tap, and the battery falls off, even when on your wrist. you risk losing the battery, also its annoying because it shuts off every time it pops out.

so the negative out of the way. the band is durable, and the watch seems durable as well.
not water proof or water resistant.
honestly, its not worth the money. the bluetooth and battery issue killed it completely for me.

on another note, because i can now see how much mah there is left on a battery, the batteries that i put in thomas the train's, one of the batteries still had at least 25-50% mah left. so i'm thinking the oem battery charger which requires 2 batteries at a time, stops charging when one of the batteries in the pair gets fully charged even though the other is not at full capacity yet.",1.0

if you do get this, the best light source seems to be a light box (which i do not have) or setting your computer monitor to a blank word processing page and adjusting the monitor's brightness. on the other hand, experimenting with various light sources (color and intensity) could create a whole new avenue for manipulating the results, but i'd rather do that in photoshop, etc.

email colloquy yielded knowledge that only addonics drives work with the adapter and that one adapter is needed for each drive, but when i asked for an rma number to return the adapter, the emails fell silent.

i got through to their telephonic customer service and a snotty agent said i was out of luck. i had to use addonics drives and i had to format then through the adapter. the agent informed me of a 15% restocking fee which i said i will not pay because addonics misled me with its bogus advertising. the agent said, ""too bad, you will have to be docked the 15%."" i responded that i will dispute the purchase through my credit card and that is exactly what i did. i shipped the adapter back to addonics.

pros: touchscreen makes everything easier, explanations for the different modes are in camera, smart capture takes out the guess work, great macro shots, image stabilization works like a dream; your subject could spin like a tazmanian devil, and it still takes a great still shot.

cons: touch screen is practically invisible in sunlight. you have to hold your hand over the screen to make it out. the battery door is flimsy. lense stays out every time your turn the camera on. must charge battery in camera.

using the same care i hooked everything back up exactly as before but now we have a big problem! my video now blinks off and on and nothing displayed from any source through this switch is stable!!!  everything blinks!!

i took each cable one by one and connected it to my tv to test and no problem at all, afterwards i connect everything to switch and bam, it is all blinking off and on again!!

the removable protectors on the glass leave a horrible residue that needs to be literally scrubbed for 20 min.
the glass does not have the same coating as the apple glass so it gets dirty within seconds of using.
you can see the grid on the screen but this was not a huge deal.
the biggest issue is the adhesive
it says to fully teat unit before removing the adhesive because its non returnable afterwards
the problem is you cant test the adhesive which is subpar
in less than a week after install the bottom edge popped off and would lift easily.
i have used a heat gun on it a couple times and sat heavy items on it to try and set the adhesive with little luck.

i think these mdr-xb60ex are ok they did not blow me away, they sounded very similar bass wise to my previous ones which were significantly cheaper,i figured my head would be rumbling for the price but i cant complain because the bass is still very prominent.

pros:
bass yes, there is bass if that is what your looking for :)

the only minus (and reason i took away a star) is that the color of the letters on the keys are nearly impossible to see (i bought the black version... in the pictures the letters are white, on the actual keyboard they are an extremely dark grey). not a big deal for me, since i am mostly a touch typist, but i could see it being a problem for some people.",1.0

the installation is a little bit tough, because the case is so well designed, and leave no room for air.  so be patient.  it is best to install the right side first, then the left side, so that the air can be pushed out of the edge that snapped onto the rim of the phone.

anyways, back to the card review. i bought this at $184 with a $20 rebate, and at that price, it was as steal. this is fermi architecture on the cheap! yes the 560 ti is great, but the benchmarking difference between the two is not worth the extra $50-$70 for me (only like 5-10 more fps if that). i do all of my gaming at 1920x1080 and i'm able to play dragon age ii, crysis 2, and street figther 4 with everything maxed out, full aa, and dx11, with no lag at all. i'm quite happy.",1.0

2430,we have purchased 6 nikon digital cameras over the last 5 years.  we have been pretty happy with all of them so we keep buying nikon even after looking closely at cannon and sony.  we started with a 3 mp and have graduated over the years.  this one is the best so far on picture quality.  it has a nice large screen and is slim and easy to pocket.  we purchased this one to replace a 4 mp nikon because it was painstakingly slow to recharge between flash pictures and the lag time for click to shutter release was frustrating.  i'm happy to report that this one is far better in both respects.  the only drawback is the lack of a regular viewfinder.  unfortunately that seems to be the case in all the entry level cameras regardless of brand these days.,1.0

while i no longer have my test equipment, i still have my reference headphones for comparison, and i must concur with the reviewers who hated these speakers. they remind me of the ""early"" days of bookshelf speakers, when the goal was to make ""spectacular"" sound, with emphasized bass and treble, rather than delivering smooth, flat response.

the bass must be turned waaaay down to the bare minimum for anything resembling flat response, and the tweeters go shrill when there is any high frequency signal. even worse is a huge, deep hole in the midrange - right where human voices lie. the result is that the more you listen to them, the more you hate them.

it is hard to find a wireless headphone that will wrap around your ear without covering it up, so these were originally appealing to me, but please please please, save yourself the headache of having to worry about if your headphones will work when you get to the gym and pay the extra for a good brand name that will not screw you over",0.0

the solar charging is a fantastic idea, and gets you through a couple of years without changing the battery. the battery does eventually need to be changed, which used to be a real hassle. but they have made that easier to do in the more recent models.

the only inconvenience is that i have had two of them die. the first was my fault, from a coffee spill. but my second keyboard just keeled over without warning or provocation when it was only three months old.

i do consider this a bluetooth clock radio because it is a bluetooth radio with a clock. true enough, you cannot use the alarm feature to play your music via bluetooth, but to be honest i never imagined it would. it pairs easily with my phone and the bt seems to work flawlessly. the only downside in my opinion is the charger option does charge, but it is not a ""fast charger"" like i normally use on my phone. that being said, this does make for a nice bluetooth speaker for the bedside (do not expect concert quality audio) and indeed includes an alarm clock if you need that. i can see this replacing two items for people who have both. personally, i use my phone for the alarm anyway (as i'm sure many others do these days) so what this product gave me was a bluetooth speaker with a clock. i used to just press the button on my phone to check the time, now i can just look at the clock.",1.0

to be fair, this combo is nice: the color is beautiful, and the hdmi cable is of good quality. but when these good qualities come with a bad adapter, the result is a bad shopping experience. considering it will cost me more to return, i will keep them as a reminder: good things do not come cheap.

cons: matrix function (generates ""surround sound"" from stereo input) generates fluctuating signal for rear speakers that is muddy and cuts out.  tends to reduce overall sound quality for other speakers.

pros
-the pairing process worked reliably and consistently.

cons
-occasionally the wireless audio would cut out when the phone was pressed up against my leg in my pocket, but i found this to be a product of the phone on other wireless headphones too.
-after owning the headphones for a couple of months, the wireless audio started to malfunction. when paired via bluetooth, the audio only works on the left side speaker of the head phones. the same behavior can be seen when trying to use the audio over usb. however when using the aux cable, both speakers appear to work again.

this was a big disappointment for him because he bought these cameras for their advertised weather and shock resistance. he states clearly these cameras are ""garbage,"" ""crap,"" and ""a totally worthless endeavor that cost my department money instead of saving it.""

i will not buy lg again. i'm going with some cheap knock-offs. that way when they die, i will not be upset cause you get what you pay for. i paid decent money for the lgs and i got squat.

its remote is counter-intuitive, going against some of the standard button presses on most dvd/vcr remotes (i.e. after hitting pause, to continue recording, you must hit record, to continue playing you must hit play,  hitting pause again will not work!)

this is replacing my 22"" acer lcd that i purchased 5 years ago. that one still works too, it just takes a few minutes to turn on and it makes high pitched noises (bad capacitors?) - so i expect it is going to die soon. 5 years is a good amount of time, so i like acer and i imagine this newer, lower power led will last even longer!

3714,"lets be honest. neither ps4 or xbox one lived up to my expectations. when the original xbox came out, it was a simple console. xbox grew over time and amazed us through software updates that constantly reimagined the console. when i opened the box and turned it on for the first time--i was disappointed. the first thing which stood out was the complete lack of backwards compatibility--i have a huge collection of downloaded xbox 360 content--this is now gone. the console felt boring. there was nothing to do except watch netflix.

so why the heck did i give this product four stars? the foundation is good. i'm confident the product will grow and evolve just like the original xbox. i'm confident backwards compatibility will be added. in the mean time--i can afford to have two consoles and switch between the new and old xbox. is the console great today? no, its not. does it work, yes. do it is current minimalistic features work well, yes.  will it get better, yes.  should you buy it today? unless you like to be on the bleeding edge, my answer would be no.",1.0

overall speeds are fantastic. even on my crappy wifi card in my yoga 2 pro i'm able to get a decent speed. on devices with full ac support on the 5ghz band i'm getting speeds that are comparable to ethernet. i run a home theater through this, and i can stream blu-ray rips over the network just fine.

some are reporting the router will slow down/become unresponsive after a few days of use before needing to be power cycled. i've yet to see this behavior but it is entirely possible it is due to my use of openwrt verses the stock linksys firmware.

between the air bubbles and the size issues, i ended up throwing away the first three protectors, even though i cleaned the screen thoroughly and i was as precise and careful as possible when applying the protector. for the fourth one, i trimmed the edges with scissors before removing the backing. while it is an improvement, the size still is not quite right, and the air bubble issue remains.

when buying a projector , here are two things you need to look for:
native resolution
on a $300 to $1000 projector, the native resolution is minimum 800 x 600 or 1080p for best.

lumens
on a $300 to $1000 projector, the lumens is about 2800 to 3000

now, consider this projector, this is only 240 ( always look at the last number ) and lumens is about 80. picture will be very grainy, and picture will be very dim. your eyes will begin to ache after 30 mins from straining.

however a major problem with its design forced me to return it. for me, one of the primary reasons for buying this charger was to free up some of my power outlets, which were all occupied by individual device wall chargers.

even though this easyacc charger only plugs into one outlet, it also covers up the second outlet in a typical 2-outlet board, rendering the 2nd outlet completely unusable. this was a deal-breaker for me, hence the 2-stars, despite its solid build quality. for an outlet-saving charger, it is plug-in design should have been smarter...",0.0

3991,"i got this to switch data from my old computer with xp to my new computer with vista, it not only did not load on ether computer correctly or not at all it missed up some files on the new computer that i had to spent two hours to fix. all i ended up with was a double ended male usb cable, that i will probably never use. since once you open the box you cannot take software back. the box also stated that if you had bought a new computer that there would be a 20 dollar rebate, i tried,the site dose not appear to be working. i ended up using a cruzer (jump, or flash drive) to copy the stuff i wanted to the new computer. do not wast you money like i did.",0.0

3995,"i had this thing connected to my radio for quite a while, then one day my reception improved noticeably. i looked behind and the terk tower cable had fallen loose from the radio. so my radio worked better with no antenna than with the terk tower.

i can only imagine that my issues are multi-path type problems and not signal strength. whatever, this gadget did not work for me. and it had that green light too!",0.0

3999,"the unit simply will not allow us to install it. we spent three hours the first day working with the service tech to install it. she kept telling us to re-boot it. we did and did and did. we finally decided to have our computer repairman install it. he could not and suggested that we needed a new modem. so we purchased a new modem. nope, do dice, still does not work. we kept trying to get a reply from their customer service for two weeks-nothing. it is useless. oh well, it is just a toy. it is going back! it does not deserve one star!",0.0
